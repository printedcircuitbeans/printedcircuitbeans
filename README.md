Hello!



# What you need to know about me :

I'm a high school student aspiring to work in Robotics and Aerospace.

I'm interested in several domains, notably robotics, aerospace engineering, rocketry, embedded system design and automation.

I've self learnt nearly all of the knowledge I apply in my projects

I have successfuly completed several personal projects independently ( see my repositories )

## Languages:

Fluent in English, French, Spanish

Basic level in German.



## My skills:

CAD - Fusion360, FreeCAD, SolidWorks, OnShape

EDA - EasyEDA, Alitum Circuitmaker

3D printing - Nearly 6 years of experience - And DFM with FDM technology (see Desktop-Robot-Arm)

Sheetmetal forming and cutting (see Desktop-Laptop)

Strong microsoldering and soldering skills, PCB rework

Good at creative problem solving and reverse engineering

Capable of analysing datasheets, selection and optimization of components for PCBs, as well as PCB layout (see RP2040-SM-PCB)



## Coding :

I code in C++ mostly but I adapt to other coding languages pretty easily



## Competions:

Participated in the French olymipades de SI (engineering) as a group of 4 in 2025 and won a runner up prize of most enviromentally friendly project despite logistical problems and tech failures

We're going to the same competion again, this time hoping to get to the nationals (see OSI-2026-Trash-Sorter)
