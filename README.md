Hello!

- What you need to know about me :
I'm a high school student aspiring to work in Robotics and Aerospace.
I'm interested in several domains, notably robotics, aerospace engineering, rocketry, embedded system design and automation.
I've self taught myself nearly all of the knowledge I apply in my projects

- Languages:
Fluent in English, French, Spanish
Can communicate on a basic level in German.

- My skills:
-CAD - Fusion360, FreeCAD, SolidWorks
-EDA - EasyEDA, Alitum Circuitmaker
-3D printing - Nearly 6 years of experience
-Sheetmetal forming and cutting

Strong microsoldering and soldering skills, PCB rework
Good at problem solving and reverse engineering (As well as coming up with my own ideas)
Capable of analysing datasheets and making my own PCBS (see RP2040-SM-PCB)

- Coding : 
I code in C++ mostly but I adapt to other coding languages pretty easily


- Competions:
Participated in the French olymipades de SI (engineering) as a group of 4 in 2025 and won a runner up prize of most enviromentally friendly project despite logistical problems and tech failures
We're going to the same competion again, this time hoping to get to the nationals (see OSI-2026-Trash-Sorter)
